## **Overview**

I create this game for my 3-year-old toddler. This idea came from one of her favorite books <Let’s find Violet’s Toy>. This book was published by the LeapFrog company. It's a story about how the dog Violet eventually found its toy.I created this game as part of my coding project.

### **1. What Is It?**

- The Goal of The Game

  - This game is based on the book <Let’s find Violet’s Toy> published by the LeapFrog company. This is a narrative storybook. It helps children learn how stories are put together. As children begin to see that storybooks include characters, settings, and a sequence of events with a clear beginning, middle and end, they can better comprehend new stories.
  - The book introduces children to words and feelings through activities.
  - This game is designed to be easy, attractive and fun for children to play.
  - This game is also perfect for family time.

- Target Audience

  - 3-years-old toddler
  - Parents who want to teach their children literacy skills

- Style Elements
  - **Fonts**
  
    *Roboto* has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.

    *Fjalla One* is a medium contrast display sans serif. Fjalla One has been carefully adjusted to the restrictions of the screen. Despite having display characteristics Fjalla One can be used in a wide range of sizes.

  - **Icons**

    Icons from Font Awesome used to style social links to create a tidy and easy access for subscription.
