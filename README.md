- Style elements
  - **Fonts**
  
    *Roboto* has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.

    *Fjalla One* is a medium contrast display sans serif. Fjalla One has been carefully adjusted to the restrictions of the screen. Despite having display characteristics Fjalla One can be used in a wide range of sizes.
